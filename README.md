## Description

This project demonstrates the integration of OpenAI's powerful natural language processing capabilities with a personalized college database. By combining these technologies, the project aims to provide users with an enhanced experience in querying and retrieving information from the college database using natural language.

## Features

- **OpenAI Integration:** Leverage OpenAI's state-of-the-art language model to perform natural language-based queries on the college database.
- **Personalized College Database:** Utilize a custom database designed specifically for your college's information, allowing for accurate and contextually relevant responses.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to input queries and receive responses.
